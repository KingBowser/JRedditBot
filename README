JRedditBot is a modular event-based reddit bot.
JRedditBot simply provides a middleman work system between JReddit and JRB plugins.

JRB manages an instance of EventBus and an instance of JReddit. It is designed to check for changes to specified userpages and subreddits.
 Upon discovering changes - new posts or comments - it publishes an appropriate event to the EventBus.
 Plugins may subscribe to events, and then act upon them.

Adopters are expected to store the bot on a private machine, as the bot user pasword is stored (not transmitted) in a configuration.
